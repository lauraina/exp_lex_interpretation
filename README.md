# Modeling word interpretation with deep language models: The interaction between expectations and lexical information

This repository contains the code and language model necessary to replicate the framework presented in " Modeling word interpretation with deep language models: The interaction between expectations and lexical information " (to appear in Proc. CogSci 2020).

### Contents of the repository

* Code for extracting representations from LSTM and BERT models, as reported in the paper:
  - lexical information
  - expectations
  - expectation-driven word interpretation, with avg or delta operations, modulated by parameter alpha 

* Bidirectional LSTM language model used in the experiments reported in the paper (`LSTM/model.pt`)

*  `src/demo.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook showing how to extract representations and basic functions to evaluate them (e.g,, cosine similarity, nearest neighbors)
